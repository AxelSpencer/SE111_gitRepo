            <h2>REVIEW</h2>
            <p><b>Axel Fernandes-Spencer</b> <i>January 1, 2022</i></p>
            <p>I've recently gone on a big Quintin Tarantino binge. <em>Inglourious Basterds</em> being the most recent one I've seen, and I gotta say, It's pretty good. The whole premise of the movie revolves around Nazi propaganda through the use of the film industry, something I'm sure leaves a great distaste to Tarantino himself.</p>
            <p>We start out the movie already establishing the evils of the Nazi ideology through the great performance of Christolph Waltz as Hans "The Jew Hunter" Landa. The rest of the movie somewhat settles down, with the occasional dark comedy sprinkled in, which was able to keep my attention through the second act, finally ending on a ridiculous high note.</p>
            <p>Overall I think this movie is a solid watch for anyone that can stomach the violence, as it presents nuanced take on killing off the Nazis with the same 30mm film they used to brainwash the german populous.</p>
            <p><b>Trivia</b></p>
            
            <ul>

                <li>Quentin Tarantino was considering abandoning the film entirely while searching for someone to play Colonel Hans Landa took place, fearing he'd written an impossible role. However, after Christoph Waltz auditioned both Tarantino and producer Lawrence Bender agreed they had found the perfect actor for the role.</li>
                <li>Quentin Tarantino worked on the script for almost a 10 years. This co-insides with the movies last line being, "You know somethin Uitivich, I think this just might be my masterpiece." as Brad Pitt Stares directly into the camera.</li>
                <li>Only 30% of the film is actually spoken in English. The language that dominates the film is actually French, German, and a little Italian. Which is highly unusual for a Hollywood production.</li>
            
            </ul>
