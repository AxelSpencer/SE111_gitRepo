    <h1 style="border:1px solid blue;">Axel Fernandes-Spencer</h1>

    <p style="border:1px solid blue;">Hello my name is Axel, I am 18 years old, and i'm currently studying to become a Software Engineer at New England Institute of Technology. Although I was born in Spain, long story, I lived most of my early life in Cape Verde. I was about 11 years old when I finally immigrated to the states. I have two parents and one older brother. I like video games, anime, manga, and I occasionally draw.</p>
